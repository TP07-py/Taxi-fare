# **Taxi Fare Calculator ğŸš–**
A Python program that calculates the total cost of a taxi trip based on user-defined inputs for the base fare, rate per meter, and distance traveled in miles.

**Features:**
- Custom Inputs: Users can dynamically set the base fare and rate per meter.
* Flexible Distance Calculation: Calculates the fare for any distance in miles.
+ User Validation: Ensures that all inputs are non-negative for accurate fare calculations.

**How It Works**

The program prompts the user to:
  * Distance traveled (in miles).
  * Base fare amount.
  * Rate per meter.

Converts the distance from miles to meters (1 mile = 1609.34 meters).

Computes the total fare using the formula:

TotalÂ Fare = BaseÂ Fare + (DistanceÂ inÂ Meters Ã— RateÂ perÂ Meter)

Displays the total cost of the trip.
